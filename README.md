# About
A quick and handy image converter developed at work for a project. Not anymore in development.

It supports a few image types (TIFF, GIF, JPEG, PNG) and converts them in JPEGs using predefined settings.

Uploaded for newcomers of Rust (like me!) as an example of Rust + gtk-rs, as there still aren't many repositories around.

# Usage
To build and run the code just use:

```sh scripts/run.sh```

and it will check the dependency and start building.
